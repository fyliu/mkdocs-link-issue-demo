# Welcome to MkDocs

### Problem link

Note: this renders fine in github but not after being processed by mkdocs in the live server

- [dev lead](https://github.com/orgs/hackforla/projects/61/views/4?filterQuery=label%3A"ready+for+dev+lead"+-status%3Adone+-ready-for%3A"Dev+Lead")

### Workaround:

Note: this is the same link as before, but I moved `status` to the end of the arguments list within `filterQuery`

- [dev lead](https://github.com/orgs/hackforla/projects/61/views/4?filterQuery=label%3A"ready+for+dev+lead"+-ready-for%3A"Dev+Lead"+-status%3Adone)

### Workaround 2:

Add a + at the end of the URL

- [dev lead](https://github.com/orgs/hackforla/projects/61/views/4?filterQuery=label%3A"ready+for+dev+lead"+-status%3Adone+-ready-for%3A"Dev+Lead"+)
